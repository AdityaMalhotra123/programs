1.  'stdint.h' is a header file in the C standard library which defines integer types, such as int32_t, with specific widths, and macros for integer constant expressions.
2.  These are unsigned and signed integer types from stdint.h that reduce the chances of making errors as the machine won't be confused unlike
    when it construes some integers as 16-bit and some as 32-bit
3.  BYTE - 1 byte (8 bits)
    DWORD - 4 bytes (32 bits)
    LONG - 4 bytes (32 bits)
    WORD - 2bytes (16 bits)
4.  The first two bytes of any BMP file are the ASCII values 'B' and then 'M'
5.  bfSize stores the size of the entire BMP file as indicated by 'BITMAPFILEHEADER' where as biSize stores the size of the structure
    as indicated by 'BITMAPINFOHEADER'
6.  If biHeight is negative, the image will appear upside down
7.  biBitCount specifies the BMP's color depth - the number of bits per pixel
8.  fopen will return NULL if the file it is trying to open doesn't exist.
9.  fread's third arguement is always 1 as the code intends to iterate over every pixel.
10. padding = 4 - (((3 * 3) % 4) % 4) = 3
11. fseek helps us change the offset of a pointe
12. SEEK_CUR is the current location indicator in the file
