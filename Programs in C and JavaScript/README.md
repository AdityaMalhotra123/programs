On running the main.js file, a game is launched. Inspired by the popular game, 'Snake,' Snake Classics uses several features that develop 
user experience. On clicking play on the home page, the user controls a snake that can move up, down, left and right through the arrow keys. 
The objective of the game is to 'eat' as many fruits as possible and build onto the length of the snake and reach a score as high as 
possible.If the snake runs into the egdes or cuts into itself, the game automatically restarts and the score resets to 0. Food items can 
appear at any point on the plane (invisible grid). 

The index.html file simply designs the background sets the dimensions of the plane on which the game is played.
There are various functions in the main.js file that perform many subroutines.
