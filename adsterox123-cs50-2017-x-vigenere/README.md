This file contains a vigenere cipher. On running vigenere.c, the user is required to input a string of letters (word or phrase), 
which represents the key for the cipher. Then, the user is prompted to enter plaintext to be encrypted. 
Each letter in the plaintext will be will be shifted according to the key to generate the ciphertext.
For each letter in the plaintext, the key translated into a numerical value according to the alphabetical order: a= 0, b= 1, c= 2...
The case of the letters will remain the same when converted to ciphertext.
