0.  Pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis is a lung disease caused by inhaling ash and sand dust.
1.  It returns a pointer to a struct which contains the usage staistics of the program.
2.  16 members
3.  We pass before and after by reference because passing large structs by value is slow and takes up alot of memory. If you're passing or returning
    structs by value, copies of those structs will get placed on the stack, potentially causing sack overflow.
4.  The first line of the for loop compises a statement of the form 'c = fgetc(fp)'. 'fgetc' gets the next character from fp and avances
    the position indicator in fp until EOF (end of file) is reached. Each character of a word goes through various conditions: if the character is an
    alphabet or an apostrophe, which is not at index 0 of the word, the character is added to the end of the word array.
    Else if the word consists of numericals, the word is ignored and skipped.
    Else if a space or punctuation mark is encountered, implying that the whole word has been audited, '\0' is appended to the word array.
5.  'fscanf' with a format string like '%s' will read characters one by one until a space is found. Since words within the text files can
    end with punctuation, 'fcanf' will view them as a part of the word, thereby complicating the reading procedure.
6. 'const' prevents changes to the string/data the parameter is pointing at. For e.g the parameters for check and load prevent changes to
    the read word or the dictionary.
